# Strata

## Time Tracking

### 30.03.2025 - Sunday

10:03 Installed FreeCAD and started [research](https://infill.hackclub.com/overview/getting-started).
12:14 No idea where to start - still doing research. On the infill slack, I noticed some people reccomending that the printhead be designed first, and then the rest - just to ensure it fits.
18:11 I've decided on a CoreXY printer.
18:44 Looking at the differences between a Direct Drive and a Bowden extruder.
19:43 Just watched [a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ramiM3KHYE) regarding CoreXY printers. With what was said at 8:07 of the video, I've decided to go with the Bowden extruder mechanism.
21:14 I feel like I'm back at square one - especially since my CAD model doesn't even exist yet. The popularity of CoreXY and not XZ, YZ, etc. makes sense, thanks to [this comment](https://www.reddit.com/r/3Dprinting/comments/ckp5l2/comment/evpotr3/).
22:22 Decided on the name Strata.
